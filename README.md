## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Understand Survival Patterns**: Analyze how factors like gender, ticket class, and embarkation point influenced survival.
- **Visualize Passenger Demographics**: Explore passenger distribution across gender, class, and embarkation points.
- **Analyze Revenue**: Examine fare contributions from different embarkation locations.
